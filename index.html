<div id="right">Sport is an important part of our lives.
There are many different sports such as basketball, soccer, tennis, volleyball, golf.
As for me, my favorite sport is swimming. When I swim, I calm down and rest. In addition, I noticed that, thanks to swimming, I get better grades not only in the classes of physical education.
I look forward to summer for swimming not only in the pool, but also in the river or in the sea.
